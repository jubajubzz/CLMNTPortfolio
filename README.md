# Hey there, Stranger! 👋🏻 This is my portfolio. ;)

I'm a Digital Product Designer, based in Brasilia-DF (BR), with an altruistic and problem-solving mindset. I work with Design thinking and DesignOps guidelines and insights to turn users and business needs into coherent experiences and products that drive balanced business value through a process of rapid exploration, product definition, and product validation.
